Log analysis:

Log analysis is the process of analyzing the computer/machine generated data which includes:

Collection of data, cleaning of data, conversion of structured form, analysis of data, and obtaining the results. Logs are  always unstructured data so we use above process.

To know or check the performance of the application. Is the application performance is in a expected way or not.

Example: Suppose we are handling 100 web servers. One of the applications has an issue. Now we need to know on which server these application is running. It&#39;s very difficult to login all the servers and check for the errors. So we can keep these logs in centralized place and analyse the log to resolve the issue.

Need of log analysis:

By analysing logs we can

1. Debug the issue
2. Predictive analysis
3. Security analysis
4. Performance analysis
5. Internet of things and debugging.

Some of the challenges in log analysis are:

1. Non consistent log format: Different web applications has its own syntax for writing logs. So we need to aware of how to read the log of an application.
2. Non-consistent time format: Depends upon geographical area, the time stamp for the logs is different.
3. Decentralized: In decentralized logs are generated on each and every web server and we need to login to each web server to check the logs to troubleshoot the issue.
